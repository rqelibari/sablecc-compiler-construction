# What is this?
These are the results of my exercises for my 'compiler construction' course.

# Why do you publish this?
Mainly because of two reasons:

1. Other students may have the same problems as I did and as such may find these resources very helpful, especially the git log, which is like a step by step tutorial.
2. There are way to many fish videos out there.

# What's the toolchain?
For this course we use:

- [Eclipse][2] (currently neon, but any version is good)
- [SableCC][1] and
- [Ant][3]

# What are the principles?
We use [SableCC][1] to write a so called 'grammar' file. This file contains definitions for the lexer (like what the 'Tokens' are) and parser.

# Why is there so few content?
I work in branches for every exercise. After the submission of the exercise in question I will merge it's branch into the master branch.
So there should be new content in approx. every two weeks.
